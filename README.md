# Build-VNF

This is just an **experimental**, research and study oriented project to explore new ideas for my PhD thesis (in short, for papers ... üí°) .

## About

**Build-VNF** (Build Virtualized Network Function) is a collection (monorepo üôà) of sources and tools that I developed and used during my PhD study :wink: (2018-2022) at [ComNets TU Dresden](https://cn.ifn.et.tu-dresden.de/).

When I started my PhD in 2018, SDN/NFV was a totally new topic for me, so this monolithic repository was created to store and manage my prototype/experimental code during my studies.
Since I learned that there are already many popular and mature research and industry projects for NFVI and NFV-MANO components, I decided to investigate the possibility of building fast, energy-efficient and intelligent VNFs for 5G and beyond üòÜ.

Subdirectories are currently created for sub-projects (ideas and topics) and measurements.
Each subdirectory should contain clear READMEs for their usage.

The structure and code here is completely unstable right now, as I'm not an expert **yet** and am still in the try-error-retry loop üò¢.
I plan to create a separate repository after this one has some good and meaningful üôà results.
Better, structured documentation will be added later when the project structure is stable.

Thanks to all the open source SDN/NFV projects for teaching me.

## Project Structure

- [FFPP (Fast Forward Packet Processing)](./ffpp/README.md): A fancy üêº packet processing engine (library) designed for CNF (Containerized Network Function) and COIN (Computing in the Network) use cases
- COIN_DL: Implementing a COIN-driven distributed deep learning system for in-network video traffic compression
- pktgen: Scripts and tools for software packet generators
- scripts: Utility scripts and helpers
