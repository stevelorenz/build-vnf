This is just an **experimental**, research and study oriented project to explore new ideas for my PhD thesis (in short, for papers ... ðŸ’¡) .

## About

**Build-VNF** (Build Virtualized Network Function) is a collection (monorepo ðŸ™ˆ) of sources and tools that I developed and used during my PhD study :wink: (2018-2022) at [ComNets TU Dresden](https://cn.ifn.et.tu-dresden.de/).

When I started my PhD in 2018, SDN/NFV was a completely new topic for me, so this monolithic repository was created to store and manage my prototype code.

So the structure and code here is totally unstable because I am not expert yet and still in try-error-retry loop ðŸ˜¢.
Also I'm keep exploring new ideas and refine the topic of my PhD thesis, so I just use snippets in this repo to perform
measurements and get fancy plots quickly...
I plan to create separate repositories when there's some stable outcome from this repository.

The project is currently still under **heavy development and revision**.
Better, structured documentation will be added later when the project structure is stable.

## Repo Structure

- FFPP (Fancy Fast Packet Processing): Fancy packet processing engine designed for in-network computing
- COIN_YOLO: DNN based traffic compression
- pktgen: Scripts and tools for software packet generators
