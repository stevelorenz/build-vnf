# XDP Forwarder

The plan is to extend this forwarder to a flexible load-balancer that can be offloaded to Smart NICs.

It is inspired by the [Transit XDP (or droplet)](https://mizar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/dp_overview/) data plane
component of the [Mizar](https://mizar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project.
